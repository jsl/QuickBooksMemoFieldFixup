QuickBooks HSBC File Fixer

QuickBooks has a limitation of 255 characters for MEMO fields when importing bank transactions.  Some banks, like HSBC, 
include more than this number of characters, which causes an import to fail.  This Java program automatically truncates any
memo fields that are > 255 characters so that they can be cleanly imported.

Here are some of the pages where people complain about this issue on the Intuit site:

This program lets you select a file, and a fixed transaction file is written to disk, with a filename prepended with 
FIXED_.
